# OFF_TEN
This is a project to create a personal blogging site. It is called OFF_TEN with the idea streaming from advice from some one who was encouraging me to write 'often' so I could be a better writer. Primarily it is being built with Django for the backend and will have a few different implementations for the front-end.
